# Code Task

This project was created by James Batsell with create-react-app frontend and Rails api backend. It was created for Phase 5 of Flatiron School curriculum.

# About Code Task
Welcome to Code Task where you can track and keep notes of the progess you have made in your coding journey. 
As well as keeping track of your progress, we also have a Task list. You can use this list to prioritize what 
is most important to learn or anything else you see fit. This app was created to keep your priorites and task in the same space
without having to switch between multiple apps to do so. There are two sections in the application for a user to fill out. One being for Code tracking
and the other for the Tasks. Each are displayed in the own repsective sections.

# Using Code Task
To use Code Task on your personal machine begin by cloning down this repo. You can do this by clicking the green button in the right corner
of this screen. You will also need the backend api and you can get that here https://github.com/dreadheaddreamz/CodeLog-api. You will need to clone that repo as
well by following the same steps. On both in your terminal type git clone then copy and paste the ssh key provided by the code button in each repo. When you have both of those setup first cd into CodeLog-api for the backend and CodeLoggerFrontend for the frontend. Before you can run a backend server you'll need to run bundle install to get all you gems.
Once all your gems have been installed run rails s. For the frontend you'll need to run npm i && npm start to make sure all the proper dependancies are installed. A new browser should open to http://localhost:3000, hit refresh and you are all set to begin using Code Task.
