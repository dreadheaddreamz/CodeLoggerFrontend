This project was created with create-react-app frontend and Rails api backend.

# About Code Task
Welcome to Code Task where you can track and keep notes of the progess you have made in your coding journey. 
As well as keeping track of your progress, we also have a Task list. You can use this list to prioritize what 
is most important to learn or anything else you see fit. This app was created to keep your priorites and task in the same space
without having to switch between multiple apps to do so. There are two sections in the application for a user to fill out. One being for Code tracking
and the other for the Tasks. Each are displayed in the own repsective sections.
